# Performance Proofs

Minimal reproducible experiments for Go performance engineering claims.

## Purpose

Proofs demonstrate specific compiler, runtime, CPU, memory, and concurrency behaviors.

Each proof should explain:

- the claim;
- the cost model;
- the baseline;
- the experiment;
- the verification method;
- the benchmark or evidence;
- limitations.

A proof is not a benchmark competition.

The goal is understanding, not claiming universal speed improvements.

## Evidence Principle

Prefer:

- compiler diagnostics;
- benchmarks;
- runtime metrics;
- profiles;
- traces;
- hardware counters when required.

Avoid:

> This is faster.

Prefer:

> Under this workload and environment, this implementation reduces this measured cost.

## Historical Proofs

Some proofs may demonstrate techniques that are no longer recommended.

Examples:

- GC ballast;
- old unsafe patterns;
- previous compiler/runtime behavior.

Their purpose is understanding why a technique worked and why recommendations changed.
